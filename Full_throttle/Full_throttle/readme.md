Installation:
 In order to run the application on your local machine some requirements need to be installed.
    I have designed using "python 3.8.2" and "django 3.0.5".
    i)Dependencies
        Change the directory to the project folder and install the dependencies.
            pip install
        There is a separate dependency for user-activity-log.
            pip install django-user-activity-log

    To create new project:
        python manage.py startproject project1
    To create new application:
        python manage.py startapp application1
