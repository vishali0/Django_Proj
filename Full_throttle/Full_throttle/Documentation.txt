Introduction:
 i)This project is about designing and implemention of Django application with User and ActivityPeriod models.
 ii)I have used a custom management command to populate the database with some dummy data.
 iii)And finally designed an API to serve that data in the json format.

 This application allows us to view the users' activity log.

 In order to run the application on your local machine some requirements need to be installed.
    I have designed using "python 3.8.2" and "django 3.0.5".
